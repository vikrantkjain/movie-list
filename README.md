# Movie Management

#### Assignment - React / NextJS Full Stack Developer

#### Develop a web app. The app itself consists of a login screen and screens for displaying, creating and editing movies.

The movie entity consists of three fields:
- title (text)
- publishing year (number)
- poster (image)

#### You will be responsible for building the front end and the backend API

#### You can see all of the screens in the design available at:
https://www.figma.com/file/rsilPqu30TpPX7IOPqLPAf/Movie-list?node-id=3%3A136

#### Note that the design file consists of several pages:
- Styleguide - all colors, typography and spacings are defined there
- Components - components used within the app
- Web - The design for the web app
- Mobile - design for the Flutter developer assignment, but you can use it for the responsive design (not required, but does add extra points)

#### The assignment code must be submitted as a public GitHub repository and deployed in a cloud environment (AWS, Azure, or GCP)

#### We will get extra points for:
- Hosting the app on platforms such as GitHub pages, Heroku etc.
- Mobile responsiveness
- Form validation - showing when email/password format isnâ€™t correct or when API returns an error
- Movie list pagination
- State management
- Localization
- API documentation 
- Creativity - add anything you want to the app.
